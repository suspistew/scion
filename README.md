Scion is a 2D game library made in rust. 

## Why this project ? 

Well, firstly because it' a good way to learn.

Then because a lot of projects these days focus on adding a lot of feature pretexting feature parity with big editors or game engines. 
Here I focus on the features that I really need for my projects. I won't add things just because they are cool, but because I need them in 
a game project

Scion relies on a short list of principles that also serves as a guideline.

### Goals

- Strong focus on **2D** only.
- **Easy** and **Fun** to use.
- Clean and readable source code.

### Maybe one day goals

### Non goals

- Ultra/over optimized code and performances. For this, please try other engines or build your own !


### Notable dependencies

This are the dependencies this project is relying on. Thanks to this awesome communities, we are able to build this kind of tiny project.
